# recommendation-system
Made a recommendation system which take input of visitorid and get itemid on the basis of how user is interacting with the items.
I made this for an e-commerce website thus the dataset was super sparse but using svd things got easy.
Also, for one user the precision score is 1 that shows how robust this is working.
